# Speedtest Tracker

This program runs a speedtest check every hour and graphs the results. The back-end is written in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and the front-end uses [React](https://reactjs.org/). It uses the [Ookla's speedtest cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) package to get the data and uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to plot the results.

A demo can be found [here](https://speedtest.henrywhitaker.com)

Disclaimer: You will need to accept Ookla's EULA and privacy agreements in order to use this container.
**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project**
